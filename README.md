# Project 2 - *Flicks-Part2*

**Flicks-Part2** is a movies app displaying box office and top rental DVDs using [The Movie Database API](http://docs.themoviedb.apiary.io/#).

Time spent: **13** hours spent in total

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is completed:

- [x] User can view movie details by tapping on a cell.
- [x] User can select from a tab bar for either **Now Playing** or **Top Rated** movies.
- [x] Customize the selection effect of the cell.

The following **optional** features are implemented:

- [x] For the large poster, load the low resolution image first and then switch to the high resolution image when complete.
- [x] Customize the navigation bar.

The following **additional** features are implemented:
- [x] Learned how to create and design an xib file
- [x] Created some nice animations for the main screen
- [x] Redesigned the UI
- [x] Created a tab bar application with a home page(very challenging)



Please list two areas of the assignment you'd like to **discuss further with your peers** during the next class (examples include better ways to implement something, how to extend your app in certain ways, etc):

1. Use a service like Parse
2. Start allowing users to vote

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.
Animations were a bit tricky. Hardest part was getting a home screen to show up on an app with a tab bar.
