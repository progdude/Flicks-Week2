# Project 1 - *MovieViewer*

**MovieViewr** is a movies app using the [The Movie Database API](http://docs.themoviedb.apiary.io/#).

Time spent: **7** hours spent in total

## Notes

AFNetworking provided me with a lot of errors at first. In addition, getting some animations and UI to work was quite challenging.
